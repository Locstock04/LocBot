# LocBot
loc bot, a bot by loc

### What is it
Loc Bot is a discord bot written in Python, it contains a wide variety of commands, developed for a group of friends to have better voice commands at first but now continues to be worked on hobby project and to keep using for personal discord use. 

### How to run
The actual Loc Bot is private, however, you can run your own version by following the steps below
1. Make sure you have the necessary stuff to run a discord bot, this means having [python](https://www.python.org/) and [discord py](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/intro.html)
2. Create a clone of this repository
3. Set up a [bot application](https://discord.com/developers/applications)
4. Create a .txt document in the same folder as the clone (next to the locbotmain.py file), this .txt should contain only Discord bot token that you can get from the 'Bot' section of the application
5. On the [application](https://discord.com/developers/applications) screen select OAuth2, select bot and Administrator then open the provided link to add the bot to a server and make sure Privileged Gateway Intents are all turned on
6. Open locbotmain.py (you may need to install certain things for some cogs of the bot however, the majority should work)
